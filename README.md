Marvel API characters with Vainilla JS

Using a timestamp, a public and a private key hash with md5 Algorithm to fetch data from Marvel's site through their API.

I use Vainilla JS and bootstrap 4 to render the results in the browser.

By default you get the 20 first characters and then you are able to search characters by name that "starts with" anything that you write in the search input...

You may then also "Delete" some of the characters once you get the results of your query by clicking the "Delete" button inside of every card.

Thanks Marvel for this and you can visit their site at https://www.marvel.com/characters or the developers site at https://developer.marvel.com/!

Disclaimer: In production you wouldn't and shouldn't use your API keys from the frontend and you may want to use them from the backend for security reasons. In this case it is just a test and anyone that sign up on Marvel's site can get these type of key to make this kind of free of charge queries with Marvel's limitations according to their site terms of use and agreement.
